You can leave HS's you don't own (yet) selected as they'll have no impact, this way once you do get them you don't need to re-check them, by default all are selected.

Works better than writing your own macro since you don't have to figure out the toy ID for each stone, plus that ID can change when you get a new toy and if you have filters set in your toybox UI.

Creates a macro named RHT upon first logon RHT to find it easier.  After the first cast while not in combat, it is renamed to <space> and will not display lettering anymore.

Should an update to the game break the macro, the next update of this addon will _delete_ the old macro and you'll have to add the new one to your bars.
  
Should be no issues with localization since everything is based on item ID.
